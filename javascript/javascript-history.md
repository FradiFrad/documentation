# Javascript

## History

### 1995 : creation

- Marc Andreessen (founder of Netscape Communications) wanted a **more dynamic web**.
  - Creation of Mocha : Simple, dynamic, and accessible to non-developers.
  - Then Mocha/LiveScript is renamed JavaScript.
    - Marketing pressure explains the proximity with Java language, popular at the time.
      - Javascript = a scripting language for small client-side tasks in the browser
      - Java = promoted as a bigger, professional tool to develop rich web components.
    - Born in a hurry

### 1997 : maintenance in ECMA

- Netscape handed the job of creating a language specification to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), a body founded with the goal of standardizing computing.

### 2005 : AJAX and the road to asynchronous times

- A paper released by Jesse James Garrett introduced Ajax, a revolutionary suite of technologies that included JavaScript.
- Ajax :

  - Asynchronous JavaScript + XML
  - a fundamental shift in what’s possible on the Web :
    - classic web application model : most user actions in the interface trigger an HTTP request back to a web server. The server does some processing — retrieving data, crunching numbers, talking to various legacy systems — and then returns an HTML page to the client.
      => synchronous : while the server is doing its thing, the user is waiting. "Start-stop-start-stop" nature of the interaction on the Web
      => not a great user experience.
    - Ajax model : an intermediary — an Ajax engine — between the user and the server. "Allows the user’s interaction with the application to happen asynchronously — independent of communication with the server."
      => asynchronous : "the user is never staring at a blank browser window and an hourglass icon, waiting
      around for the server to do something."
      => best user experience

- Result : JavaScript is seen as a more professional programming language.

### 2015 : major features in ECMA

- Take JavaScript to a bigger audience, and to aid in programming in the large.

### Now

- the most commonly used programming language (2019)
- from client-side language (meaning it runs on your computer within your browser) to servers, with Node.js
- It is now even possible to write native mobile apps using JavaScript.
