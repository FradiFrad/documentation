# History

1995 creation
the most commonly used programming language (2019)

Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape Communications and part of the ex-Mosaic team, had the vision that the web needed a way to become more dynamic. Creation of Mocha : Simple, dynamic, and accessible to non-developers.
995, Netscape Communications and Sun closed the deal: Mocha/LiveScript would be renamed JavaScript, and it would be presented as a scripting language for small client-side tasks in the browser, while Java would be promoted as a bigger, professional tool to develop rich web components.

JavaScript was born in a hurry, but several powerful features were part of it from the beginning.

- Java-like Syntax
- Functions as First-Class Objects

JavaScript is a scripting language that is one of the three core languages used to develop websites.
Whereas HTML and CSS give a website structure and style, JavaScript lets you add functionality and behaviors to your website, allowing your website’s visitors to interact with content in many imaginative ways.

Primarily a client-side language, meaning it runs on your computer within your browser.
However, more recently the introduction of Node.js has allowed JavaScript to also execute code on servers.

1997, it became clear that the language would need to be properly maintained and managed. Therefore, Netscape handed the job of creating a language specification to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA), a body founded with the goal of standardizing computing.

The year 2005 proved to be a big one for JavaScript. A paper released by Jesse James Garrett introduced Ajax, a revolutionary suite of technologies that included JavaScript. Ajax vastly improved user experience by allowing web pages to feel more like native desktop apps. This really pushed JavaScript into the spotlight as a professional programming language.

- Asynchronous JavaScript + XML
- a fundamental shift in what’s
  possible on the Web.
- The classic web application model works like this: Most user actions in the interface
  trigger an HTTP request back to a web server. The server does some processing —
  retrieving data, crunching numbers, talking to various legacy systems — and then
  returns an HTML page to the client.
  = synchronous - This approach makes a lot of technical sense, but it doesn’t make for a great user
  experience. While the server is doing its thing, what’s the user doing? That’s right,
  waiting. And at every step in a task, the user waits some more.
- An Ajax application eliminates the start-stop-start-stop nature of interaction on the Web
  by introducing an intermediary — an Ajax engine — between the user and the server
- The Ajax engine allows the user’s interaction with the
  application to happen asynchronously — independent of communication with the server.
  So the user is never staring at a blank browser window and an hourglass icon, waiting
  around for the server to do something.

Alongside client and server software, it is now even possible to write native mobile apps using JavaScript.

ECMA 2015 : hese are all features meant to take JavaScript to a bigger audience, and to aid in programming in the large.

There are only two things fundamental to JavaScript: objects and functions.
Functions in JavaScript are objects. Infact, everything in JavaScript is an object.

The other important object-category is functions. You declare a function like so:
function functionName() { // This is a "function declaration".
// Do something…
}
You can also define functions as expressions (function expressions), for example:
var x = function() {};

Functions are objects (remember, everything is an object). And this is powerful: this means that functions can be returned from functions and passed into functions as arguments.

Scopes in JavaScript are defined by functions
